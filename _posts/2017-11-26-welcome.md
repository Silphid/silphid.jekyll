Hey! Nice to have you here!

This blog is my way of sharing with the community all my love for software design, including what I like to consider the most precious things that I've come across throughout my last few decades as a developer.

We'll cover a broad range of topics, from high level concepts, patterns and best practices, to reactive development (Rx) and dependency injection (DI), all with C# and Unity 3D as playground.  I will use many concrete examples from the [Silphid.Unity](https://github.com/Silphid/Silphid.Unity) framework that I've recently released on github.

My ultimate hope would be that you find in those posts some uplifting ideas that may transform the way you envision development, no matter your experience level.

Enough said! Good reading and don't forget to subscribe to receive the latest posts as they are published! :)

Bon voyage!
Mathieu
