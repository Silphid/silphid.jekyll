Hey! Nice to have you here!

This blog is my way of sharing with the community all my love and passion for development, including what I like to consider the most precious things that I've learned and discovered throughout my last few decades as a software developer, designer and architect.  Topics will range from abstract concepts to concrete code examples, using C# and Unity to demonstrate reactive development, dependency injection, design patterns, best practices and so much more.

I hope you fill find in those posts some ideas that will bring your development skills to a higher level, no matter your level of experience.

Enough said! Good reading and don't forget to subscribe to receive the latest posts as they are published! :)

Regards,
Mathieu
