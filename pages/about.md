Hello! My name is Mathieu Frenette and I work for a great software company named [LVL Studio](http://www.lvlstudio.com), in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where I lead the design of our E2 initiative, a multiplatform video application development solution, based on Unity 3D and C#, for aspiring Netflixes and other giants of the media industry.

I am passionate about design patterns, best practices, reactive extensions (Rx) and dependency injection. I enjoy cycling, yoga and some slacklining and I love to teach others and share knowledge.

Out of my experience of the past few decades, I created the [Silphid.Unity](http://github.com/silphid/silphid.unity) open-source MVVM framework, to which my colleagues have greatly contributed, and which has become the foundation of our E2 platform.

Going backwards in time, shortly after the *dot com* era, I cofounded [Simbioz](http://www.simbioz.com), where I designed gesture-based interactive systems and applications for 13 years, using C# and XAML.

Further yet back in time, some twenty years ago, I quit college to devote myself for two years to the development of an ambitious video game named [Clone]({{ "clone" | absolute_url }}), that would become a most eloquent informal diploma and land me my first job in the software industry.

To learn why I like to call myself a *mindful software designer*, read my [welcome]({{ "welcome" | absolute_url }}) post and don't forget to [subscribe](#subscribe) to this blog !
