Back in 1996-97, I momentarily quit college to devote myself to a wonderful 2-year journey that would take me from a simple – but very nice – idea, to a complete shareware title distributed by a commercial publisher.

# A handful of great reviews

> If you enjoy creative and devilish turn-based puzzle games that never seem to run out of surprises, Clone is a game for you. With 6 huge worlds and a near endless variety of levels, it is definitely one of the best shareware puzzlers ever made.

> […] I put this on the same level as Lemmings, The Incredible Machine and other great puzzlers from the nineties. It’s a game so varied and so well designed that any puzzle fan would be utterly remiss to pass it by.”

> This is an excellent puzzle game that I can highly recommend. […] The levels are well thought out, and there are a good variety of puzzles. The sound effects were spot-on, and I loved our hero’s speech. The graphics were brilliant, with every episode having a distinct theme. […] If you like challenging puzzle games, you are sure to love this one.

# Download it now

Old PC game fans all know the DOS BOX emulator can do miracles in bringing back old memories alive.

- Download and install [DOS BOX](https://www.dosbox.com/) and [Clone](https://archive.org/download/Clone_1020/clone10.zip).
- Or play it in your browser at [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/Clone_1020)! Even though the performance is not quite as good as a native installation, I was very surprised to discover via Google that Clone was hosted to be played on the web!

# YouTube has it all

I was also astounded to find very recent (2017) video walk-throughs of the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzKPFc49Sm4) and [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N49L0b0z398&t=2611s) episodes on YouTube by a Clone enthousiast! :)
