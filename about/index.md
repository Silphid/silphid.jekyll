Hey there!  My name is Mathieu Frenette and I like to call myself a mindful software designer!  I am passionate about design patterns, best practices, reactive development, dependency injection and, in my personal life, I enjoy cycling, yoga, some slacklining and... friends! :)

### LVL Studio

I'm currently working at LVL Studio as Senior Software Designer, leading our E2 initiative, a Unity-based platform for the rapid development of multiplatform Netflix-like video-centric applications.  As a personal project, I developed the [Silphid.Unity](http://github.com/silphid/silphid.unity) open-source MVVM framework, which is now used as foundation for E2.

I started at LVL in 2014 as Lead Software Developer on great projects, like Cineplex's iOS and Android app (using Xamarin) for which I developed the Proteus Framework, and then LeapFrog's Epic Android tablet (using Unity) and then Invidi's Ads Targeting Platform (a big data system using Java).

I then occupied the role of Director of Technology for 9 months, and I loved empowering the Dev, QA and IT teams in delivering exceptional products.  However, I was badly missing getting my hands dirty with code, especially the creative aspect of it, so I finally moved to the role of Senior Software Designer/Artchitect, to lead and design our E2 platform.
